I am a PhD student in the [PreMeDICaL](https://team.inria.fr/premedical/) team at Inria, and also affiliated with [Desbrest Institute of Epidemiology and Public Health](https://idesp.umontpellier.fr/) at University of Montpellier. I am very fortunate to be advised by [Julie Josse](http://juliejosse.com/) and [Antoine Chambaz](https://helios2.mi.parisdescartes.fr/~chambaz/). Previously I obtained my MSc in Data Science at ETH ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland, and BEng in Electrical Engineering and Automation at Xi'an Jiaotong University, China.

My research interests lie on causal inference, semiparametric statistics, policy learning, and applications to medicine.
